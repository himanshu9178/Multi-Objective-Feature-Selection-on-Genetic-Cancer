## Multi-Objective Feature Selection on Genetic Cancer 
### Bioinformatics stands at the nexus of computational and biological
sciences, playing a pivotal role in the advancement of medical
research. A domain of pressing importance is the intricate realm of
genetic cancer datasets. Our project endeavors to amplify the
effectiveness and precision of classification models across diverse
cancer types, utilizing multi-objective feature extraction to hone
accuracy. Leukemia, with its rich genetic dataset, offers a
foundational springboard. However, our vision extends beyond,
aiming to validate methodologies across an array of genetic cancers,
including prominent ones like colon, lung, and cervical. Recognizing
the rapid innovations in bioinformatics, we are also poised to harness
and potentially incorporate groundbreaking techniques that emerge
in 2023. Our aspiration is twofold: to elucidate salient features from
voluminous datasets, leading to robust classification models, and to
render a seminal contribution to the overarching domain, setting the
stage for more exhaustive research in genetic diseases and
bioinformatics.

## Abstract
Microarray data analysis plays a key role in the development of effective diagnostic and treatment procedures as well as the identification of biomarkers necessary for the classification of genetic cancer. To obtain the discriminative features necessary for precise cancer subtype classification, we have taken four common microarray datasets. We provide a novel method called Multi-Objective Crayfish Optimization Algorithm (MOCOA) with the K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) method functioning as the wrapper classifier, which effectively searches for feature subsets that simultaneously optimize several objectives by navigating the high-dimensional space of microarray data. For improving the speed of convergence, a mutual information (MI) based initialization technique used here instead of random initialization. To evaluate MOCOA's effectiveness, we carry out extensive experiments in which we compare its performance with the latest multi-objective optimization algorithms, such as Multi-Objective Grew Wolf Optimization (MOGWO), Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm (MOGA), and Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization (MOPSO). The proposed approach proves MOCOA's superiority in finding feature subsets with an acceptable trade-off between feature dimensionality and classification accuracy through experimentation and performance evaluation. In this article, the quality of the pareto front is measured in terms of a very well known multi-objective performance indicator called Inverted Generational Distance (IGD). Our results highlight MOCOA's promise as a reliable tool for genetic cancer classification tasks and provide understandings of the intricate relationship between genetic characteristics and cancer subtypes. By developing a novel algorithm designed especially for microarray data analysis and feature selection in genetic cancer classification, this work advances the field of bioinformatics.
