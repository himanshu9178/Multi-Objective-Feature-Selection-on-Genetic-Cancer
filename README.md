## Multi-Objective Feature Selection on Genetic Cancer 
### Bioinformatics stands at the nexus of computational and biological
sciences, playing a pivotal role in the advancement of medical
research. A domain of pressing importance is the intricate realm of
genetic cancer datasets. Our project endeavors to amplify the
effectiveness and precision of classification models across diverse
cancer types, utilizing multi-objective feature extraction to hone
accuracy. Leukemia, with its rich genetic dataset, offers a
foundational springboard. However, our vision extends beyond,
aiming to validate methodologies across an array of genetic cancers,
including prominent ones like colon, lung, and cervical. Recognizing
the rapid innovations in bioinformatics, we are also poised to harness
and potentially incorporate groundbreaking techniques that emerge
in 2023. Our aspiration is twofold: to elucidate salient features from
voluminous datasets, leading to robust classification models, and to
render a seminal contribution to the overarching domain, setting the
stage for more exhaustive research in genetic diseases and
bioinformatics.
