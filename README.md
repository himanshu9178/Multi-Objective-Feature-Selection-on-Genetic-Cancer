## Multi-Objective Feature Selection on Genetic Cancer 
Bioinformatics stands at the nexus of computational and biological
sciences, playing a pivotal role in the advancement of medical
research. A domain of pressing importance is the intricate realm of
genetic cancer datasets. Our project endeavors to amplify the
effectiveness and precision of classification models across diverse
cancer types, utilizing multi-objective feature extraction to hone
accuracy. Leukemia, with its rich genetic dataset, offers a
foundational springboard. However, our vision extends beyond,
aiming to validate methodologies across an array of genetic cancers,
including prominent ones like colon, lung, and cervical. Recognizing
the rapid innovations in bioinformatics, we are also poised to harness
and potentially incorporate groundbreaking techniques that emerge
in 2023. Our aspiration is twofold: to elucidate salient features from
voluminous datasets, leading to robust classification models, and to
render a seminal contribution to the overarching domain, setting the
stage for more exhaustive research in genetic diseases and
bioinformatics.

## Abstract - 1
Cancer is a vital disease taking several lives every year. Early detection can prevent lots of terrible cases. Traditional methods frequently don't achieve the best possible accuracy of diagnosis in the detection of cancer. This paper presents a complete framework to improve the feature selection process for cancer detection by integrating a multi-objective optimization approach. Developing a strong multi-objective feature selection method that optimizes computing efficiency, sensitivity, and specificity is one of the main goals. The proposed methodology leverages multi-objective feature selection and the Crayfish Optimization Algorithm (COA), using clues from crayfish behavior to improve exploration and exploitation at different phases. Thorough research and analysis have shown that the hybrid technique works well for optimizing feature subsets. When multi-objective optimization and COA are used, interpretability is enhanced as well as the precision of classification. The study's findings indicate positive advancements in the field of cancer, and the suggested design holds great potential for streamlining feature selection procedures and lowering the complexity of cancer data. MO-COA excels over MOGA and MOPSO, achieving 96.7\% average accuracy in breast cancer with 3 average features, surpassing MOGA's 95.3\% (2 features) and MOPSO's 95.7\% (4 features). In lung and cervical cancer, MO-COA achieves 60.5\% (10 features) and 95.5\% (5 features) accuracies respectively, outperforming MOGA (52.2\% lung, 95.2\% cervical) and MOPSO (52.4\% lung, 94.2\% cervical). The average is taken for total non-dominated solutions for each algorithm over different datasets. These findings underscore MO-COA's efficiency over other algorithms in enhancing cancer diagnosis accuracy with minimal features, benefiting both research and clinical practice.
## Abstract - 2
Microarray data analysis plays a key role in the development of effective diagnostic and treatment procedures as well as the identification of biomarkers necessary for the classification of genetic cancer. To obtain the discriminative features necessary for precise cancer subtype classification, we have taken four common microarray datasets. We provide a novel method called Multi-Objective Crayfish Optimization Algorithm (MOCOA) with the K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) method functioning as the wrapper classifier, which effectively searches for feature subsets that simultaneously optimize several objectives by navigating the high-dimensional space of microarray data. For improving the speed of convergence, a mutual information (MI) based initialization technique used here instead of random initialization. To evaluate MOCOA's effectiveness, we carry out extensive experiments in which we compare its performance with the latest multi-objective optimization algorithms, such as Multi-Objective Grew Wolf Optimization (MOGWO), Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm (MOGA), and Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization (MOPSO). The proposed approach proves MOCOA's superiority in finding feature subsets with an acceptable trade-off between feature dimensionality and classification accuracy through experimentation and performance evaluation. In this article, the quality of the pareto front is measured in terms of a very well known multi-objective performance indicator called Inverted Generational Distance (IGD). Our results highlight MOCOA's promise as a reliable tool for genetic cancer classification tasks and provide understandings of the intricate relationship between genetic characteristics and cancer subtypes. By developing a novel algorithm designed especially for microarray data analysis and feature selection in genetic cancer classification, this work advances the field of bioinformatics.
